## 👋 Hi, I’m Lisa Mandl

🎓 Ph.D. researcher at the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de)  
🌍 [Professorship of Earth Observation for Ecosystem Management](https://www.lss.ls.tum.de/en/eoem/start/) & [Berchtesgaden National Park](https://www.nationalpark-berchtesgaden.bayern.de)  

I explore how satellite data can help us better understand and manage (forest) ecosystem dynamics.  
I’m passionate about scalable, open, and reproducible Earth observation workflows that connect science with practice.

### 🧠 Programming languages & tools I like to use

🐍 **Python**  
Used for large-scale Earth observation workflows, such as handling raster time series (`xarray`, `rioxarray`), training machine learning models, and accessing APIs like **Google Earth Engine**.

📓 **Jupyter Notebooks**  
My go-to environment for interactive, reproducible research. Ideal for prototyping models, visualizing spatial-temporal trends, and communicating insights in both Python and R.

📊 **R**  
Trusted for statistical modeling, especially **GAMs** and **mixed-effects models** via `mgcv` and `nlme`, as well as publication-ready figures using `ggplot2`. Also used for geospatial workflows (`terra`, `sf`) in ecology and forest research.

🐚 **Bash / Shell scripting**  
Efficient for automation, high-performance computing, and batch processing of satellite imagery. Particularly useful for organizing and pre-processing large raster archives, often in combination with command-line tools such as **GDAL** for reprojection, format conversion, and tiling.

🚀 **FORCE**  
A powerful, open-source framework for generating **analysis-ready data cubes** and computing **spectral-temporal metrics** at scale. I use FORCE to preprocess and analyze multi-decadal Landsat and Sentinel time series.
